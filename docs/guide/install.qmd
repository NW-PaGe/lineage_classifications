::: callout-tip
Below there are two ways to install this software, either on your local machine (see [installation](#installation)) or via a Github Codespace which does not require any software to be installed on your personal machine (see [Github Codespace](#run-code-with-github-codespace))
:::

# Prerequisites

-   R version 4.0.0 or higher
-   Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system

# Installation {#installation}

1.  Clone the repository:

```{bash filename="terminal"}
git clone https://github.com/NW-PaGe/private-lineages.git
```

2.  Navigate to the repo folder

```{bash filename="terminal"}
cd private-lineages
```

3.  Open up the `lineages_test.Rproj` R project:

Can double click on the file or open in a terminal window by typing

```{bash filename="terminal"}
lineages_test.Rproj
```

4.  Install `renv`

In the Rstudio window's console, execute

```{r filename="R console"}
install.packages('renv')
```

5.  Install all the packages in the root directory:

```{r filename="R console"}
renv::restore()
```

## Run Code with Github Codespace {#run-code-with-github-codespace}

If you want to run the code but don't want to install anything on your local machine, use a Github Codespace.

1.  At the root of the repo, click on the **Code** drop down button
    -   On the right there is a tab called Codespaces.
    -   If there is an existing Codespace, use that one
    -   If there are no Codespaces, you can create a new one. The default codespace configuration has R and Rstudio set up for it (so probably use that one)

2.  You can run Rstudio within a Codespace by:
    -   Go into the VS Code section called "Ports" in the Codespace
    -   Find the Rstudio port
    -   Click the *Open in Browser* button
    
<br>

<br>

3.  Troubleshooting
    -   If you make a new Codespace you may need to install the R packages onto the machine again
    -   The easiest way is to open the Rstudio port (see point 2 above)
    -   In the Rstudio console execute `renv::restore()` and follow its instructions. It should download all the packages in the `renv` folder in this repo

Now you can run this code in a browser window without needing to install any software on your computer ðŸ˜Ž

# Usage {#usage}

The repo will output a `.csv` file called `lineages.csv` that will be updated whenever new lineages are updated from the CDC. You can refresh/fetch this git repo for new changes and the `.csv` file will be updated

To run the process:

1.  Run lineages script:

```{r filename="R console"}
source("scripts/lineages_public_repo.R")
```

2.  Run the lineages classification script:

```{r filename="R console"}
source("scripts/lineages_classification_for_test_repo.R")
```

## Variables

The variables produced by the scripts are used in the Sequencing and Variants Report. Here's a list:

| doh_variant_name        | Grouping variable in WA DOH Sequencing and Variant report                                                                                      |
